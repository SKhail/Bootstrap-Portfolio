# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The objective here is to leverage the capabilities of Bootstrap 5 alongside tailored CSS modifications, all within the framework of imposed constraints centered around the utilization of Media Queries. By incorporating Bootstrap 5, we aim to harness its robust set of pre-designed components and responsive grid system, complementing them with custom CSS adjustments to achieve a tailored aesthetic and functionality. Within this context, Media Queries serve as a pivotal tool for ensuring that our design remains adaptable across various devices and screen sizes, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
